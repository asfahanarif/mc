/**
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset implements a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model. A user's
 * administrative privileges are determined by the existence of a document
 * corresponding to their user ID in the '/roles_admin' collection.
 * Content collections (events, testimonials, team members) are
 * generally public to read, but all write operations (create, update, delete)
 * are restricted to authenticated administrators.
 * Forum posts can be created by anyone. Users can edit/delete their own
 * initial post one-time via a secret token. They can also reply to threads
 * they started if they provide the same secret. Admins can manage all forum content.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized into several flat, top-level collections:
 * - /events: Stores event information.
 * - /testimonials: Stores member testimonials.
 * - /team_members: Stores profiles of team members.
 * - /forum_posts: Stores public questions and their reply threads.
 * - /roles_admin: A special collection used solely for authorization. The
 *   presence of a document /roles_admin/{userId} grants admin rights.
 * This flat structure simplifies security rules and improves performance by
 * avoiding complex, nested reads for authorization checks.

    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to support the Muslimahs Club application, focusing on ease of management for events, testimonials, team members, and forum answers via a backend admin page.  The primary goal is to create a structure that is secure, scalable, and facilitates simple security rules, particularly around who can create, read, update, and delete each type of entity.\n\n**Authorization Independence:**  All data is stored in root-level collections, enabling straightforward security rules based on admin role.  No `get()` calls are required in the rules, making them more efficient and easier to debug.\n\n**Structural Segregation:**  Each content type (events, testimonials, team members, forum posts) is stored in its own dedicated collection. This segregation ensures a homogeneous security posture for each content type, simplifying security rule definition.\n\n**QAPs (Rules are not Filters):** The structure inherently supports secure `list` operations.  Since admin access is managed at the collection level, listing all documents within a collection is secured by verifying the request originates from an admin.\n\nGiven the requirement for an admin page to manage content, a simple role-based access control (RBAC) model is implemented. The presence of a document in the `/roles_admin/{uid}` collection signifies that the user is an administrator."
